# 😏 Wayne’s Delightfully Observant DevOps Intro

Professional Cloud Tamer ☁️ | YAML Life Coach | Defender of Uptime (and Sanity)

I enthusiastically automate things so humans don’t have to because if I’ve learned one thing, it’s that humans and production environments should rarely interact.

## What I bring to the table

- ✅ Scalable systems because "just reboot it" isn’t a long term strategy.
- ✅ Impeccable security passwords like "admin123" technically work, but so does leaving your car running in a parking lot.
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines because manual deployments are just hard mode for no reason.

## Open to roles where

- "Move fast and break things" isn’t the company motto (unless it’s followed by "...and Wayne fixes it").
- The phrase "It’s a DevOps issue" is met with data, not existential dread.
- Let’s build something almost as resilient as my patience for unsolicited SSH attempts.
